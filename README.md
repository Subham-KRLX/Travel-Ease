**3. Problem Statement**
Trip planning is tedious for travelers—multiple websites/apps are needed to keep track of itineraries, checklists, destinations, and essential documents. Fragmented information leads to confusion, duplicated work, and the risk of missing important details. An integrated, user-friendly solution can streamline and enhance travel planning for both new and experienced travelers.

**4. Proposed Solution / Idea**
A modern, single-page React web application allowing users to create, view, and manage their personal travel plans and itineraries. With a smooth, responsive interface (powered by Vite and React), it organizes destinations, to-dos, and packing lists in one place. Fast navigation is provided with React Router, enhanced iconography with Lucide React, and the codebase maintains high quality with strict ESLint rules.
